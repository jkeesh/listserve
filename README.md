## Real Time Listserve

This is an application for the Listserve mailing list. The idea is that it is a realtime map showing the current visitors on the site. The users can enter their name and then a point marker, a circle, and an info box show up for each user on the page. There is also a chat on the page to talk to other users.

You can see the demo at: http://listserve.firebaseapp.com

This app is built using Firebase.
